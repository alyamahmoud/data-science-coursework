Taught by: Rav Ahuja - IBM certificate in data science on coursera

A working knowledge of databases and SQL is a must to become a data scientist.
The purpose of this course was to introduce relational database concepts and help me learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. 
I also got introduced to performing SQL access in a data science environment.  The emphasis in this course was on hands-on and practical learning . 
As such,I worked with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. 
I created a database instance in the cloud, practiced building and running SQL queries through a series of hands-on labs. 
I also learnt how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

I chose the Coursera course certificate path and earned IBM digital badge upon successful completion of the course.
